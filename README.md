hi! thanks for stopping by. i'm mart and I like coding stupid and fun things. online i'm known under ThatFrogDev. i don't really know why, just thought it was funny ;)

i'm part of [hack club](https://hackclub.com) where teens gather to code together. notice we don't *hack* but *hack on* projects... so nothing malicious there ;)

## languages i know
the languages i know best (and actually made some stuff with) are Python and JS/TS, both for websites and for Node.js projects. i also know some Rust. i want to learn C, Go and Zig sometimes 

## projects i made
here are the most notable of them:
- [Drempal](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/drempal): a game where you need to dodge knives and collect coins
- [StudyMate](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/studymate): a pomodoro timer extension for your browser if you get distracted fast
- [Notabena (no longer maintained)](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/notabena): a note-taking app i made to learn some Rust (which got backed by a lot of people later, now this project is taken over by someone else)

i also make websites for people on request (currently making one for myself) and made multiple games, like [this game about loneliness](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/Solitude) in a team and I helped contribute to some open source project like Zed (code editor), Godot (game engine) and Sokora (tool to help manage communities)

some people are so productive that they got a lot of projects to showcase. i don't, really. i coded a lot in the past but got bored of a project way too soon so it's nothing much worth showing off. now i have some tricks for it so i can _actually_ show the people what i do and where my passion lies. read [this letter](https://gist.github.com/ThatFrogDev/dda1efa07b45659ffade24b880465fd0) to learn more about my journey and for some motivation.

feel free to check out "repositories" tab to see everything I made!
