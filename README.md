hi! thanks for stopping by. i'm mart and I like coding stupid and fun things. online i'm known under ThatFrogDev. i don't really know why, just thought it was funny ;)

i'm part of [hack club](https://hackclub.com) where teens gather to code together. notice we don't *hack* but *hack on* projects... so nothing malicious there ;)

## languages i know
the languages i know best (and actually made some stuff with) are Python and JS/TS, both for websites and for Node.js projects. i also know some Rust. i want to learn C, Go and Zig sometimes 

## projects i made
here are the most notable of them:
- [Drempal](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/drempal): a game where you need to dodge knives and collect coins
- [StudyMate](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/studymatr): a pomodoro timer extension for your browser if you get distracted fast
- [Notabena (no longer maintained)](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/notabena): a note-taking app i made to learn some Rust

i also make websites for people on request (currently making one for myself), helped creating [this game about loneliness](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/Solitude) in a team and I helped contribute to some open source project like Zed (code editor), Godot (game engine) and Sokora (tool to help manage communities)

feel free to check out "repositories" tab to see everything I made!
